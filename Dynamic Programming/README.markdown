# 0-1 Knapsack 

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is one of the most famous problems in [Dynamic Programming.](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/) 

> Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that  the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. - Wikipedia

## Problem

Given `KnapsackItem` items with corresponding weigths and values find the maximum total value in the knapsack by putting `KnapsackItem` items in a knapsack of capacity `capacityOfBag`. 

In other words, given array `knapsackItems` which represent values and weights associated with `KnapsackItem` items respectively. Also given an integer `capacityOfBag` which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of `knapsackItems` such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to `capacityOfBag`. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it ([0-1 Knapsack Problem](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-10-0-1-knapsack-problem/)).

`KnapsackItem` is `NSObject` class with two properties such as the weight and the value.

```swift
class KnapsackItem: NSObject {
    var weight: Int
    var value: Int
    
    init(weight: Int, value: Int) {
        self.weight = weight
        self.value = value
    }
}
```
`knapsackItems` is an array of `KnapsackItem`s.

```swift
var knapsackItems = [KnapsackItem]()
```
`capacityOfBag` is an integer representing the total weight which be put in the bag.

```swift
var capacityOfBag = Int()
```

## Solution

Whenever new item comes in you have to decide to pick this item or not and you have to find which gives you the maximum value. If you pick the item the maximum value will be the `value` of the `KnapsackItem` + whatever a `value` we get by subtracting the `weight` of this item from the `totalWeight` or the best you can do without including this item.

`capacityOfBag` is 7 and `knapsackItems`

weight | value
-------|------
1 | 1
3 | 4
4 | 5
5 | 7

Lets try solve this problem on two dimensional matrix `tableOfValues` where total number of columns is the same as `capacityOfBag`+1 and total number of rows is the same as the total `knapsackItems`. Columns represent available `totalWeight` which `weight` currently available in the bag.

```swift
var tableOfValues = [[Int]]()
    
tableOfValues = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: 0, count: capacityOfBag+1),
                          count: knapsackItems.count+1)
```

(value) weight | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |4 | 5 | 6 | 7
---------------|---|---|---|---|--|---|---|--
(1) 1 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(4) 3 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(5) 4 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(7) 5 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 

`itemIndex` is 0

The first column is all **0** which means that if `totalWeight` is **0** no matter what items we have the maximum value will be **0**.

#### Lets start solving the problem

`itemIndex` is 1

If the `totalWeight` is **1** and the weight of `KnapsackItem` is **1** the best we can do is **1**. Similarly, if the `totalWeight` is **2** and the weight of `KnapsackItem` is **1** the best we can do is **1**.

(value) weight | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |4 | 5 | 6 | 7
---------------|---|---|---|---|--|---|---|--
(1) 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
(4) 3 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(5) 4 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(7) 5 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 

`itemIndex` is 2

If the `totalWeight` is **1** and the weight of `KnapsackItem` is **3** which is greater than **1**, then **3** can never be selected. So what we do is the best we can do without selecting **3** is **1**.

(value) weight | 0 | 1 :heavy_check_mark: | 2 | 3 |4 | 5 | 6 | 7
---------------|---|---|---|---|--|---|---|--
(1) 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
(4) 3 | 0 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  | 
(5) 4 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(7) 5 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 

Again if the `totalWeight` is **2** and the weight of `KnapsackItem` is **3** which is greater than **2**, again **3** can never be selected. So what we do is the best we can do without selecting **3** is **2**.

(value) weight | 0 | 1 | 2 :heavy_check_mark: | 3 |4 | 5 | 6 | 7
---------------|---|---|---|---|--|---|---|--
(1) 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
(4) 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 |  |  |  |  | 
(5) 4 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(7) 5 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

If the `totalWeight` is **3** and the `weight` of `KnapsackItem` is **3** which is equal to **3**, we have two choices either to select **3** or not select **3**. We have to check what is the best we can do by selecting this `KnapsackItem`.

If we select this item it gives us `value` **4** + whatever `weight` is remaining after we select this `KnapsackItem` which is **3-3 = 0**. This `weight` corresponds to  `tableOfValues[itemIndex-1][totalWeight-weight]` by going up and moving three steps to left which is `tableOfValues[1][0]`. Or what is the best we can do without selecting this `KnapsackItem` which is 1.

```swift
max(value+ tableOfValues[itemIndex-1][totalWeight-weight], tableOfValues[itemIndex-1][totalWeight]) = max(4 + tableOfValues[1][0], tableOfValues[1][3]) = max(4 + 0, 1) = 4
```

(value) weight | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 :heavy_check_mark: |4 | 5 | 6 | 7
---------------|---|---|---|---|--|---|---|--
(1) 1 | ~0 | 1 | 1 |  ~1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
(4) 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4 |  |  |  | 
(5) 4 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(7) 5 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

If the `capacityOfBag` is **4** and the weight of `KnapsackItem` is **3** which is less than **4**, we have to choices to select **3** or not select **3**. We have to check what is the best we can do by selecting this `KnapsackItem`.

If we select this item it gives us `value` **4** + whatever `weight` is remaining after we select this `KnapsackItem` is **4-3 = 1** by going up and moving three steps to left which is `tableOfValues[1][1]`. Or what is the best we can do without selecting this `KnapsackItem` which is 1.

```swift
max(value + tableOfValues[2-1][4-3], tableOfValues[2-1][4]) = max(4 + tableOfValues[1][1], tableOfValues[1][4]) = max(4 + 1, 1) = 5
```

(value) weight | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  |4 :heavy_check_mark: | 5 | 6 | 7
---------------|---|---|---|---|--|---|---|--
(1) 1 | 0 | ~1 | 1 | 1 | ~1 | 1 | 1 | 1
(4) 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 5 |  |  | 
(5) 4 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(7) 5 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

If the `totalWeight` is **5** and the weight of `KnapsackItem` is **3** which is less than **5**, as before we have to choices to select **3** or not select **3**. We have to check what is the best we can do by selecting this `KnapsackItem`.

If we select this item it gives us `value` **4** + whatever `weight` is remaining after we select this `KnapsackItem` is **5-3 = 2** by going up and moving three steps to left which is `tableOfValues[1][2]`. Or what is the best we can do without selecting this `KnapsackItem` which is 1.

```swift
max(value + tableOfValues[2-1][5-3], tableOfValues[2-1][5]) = max(4 + tableOfValues[1][2], tableOfValues[1][5]) = max(4 + 1, 1) = 5
```

(value) weight | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  |4  | 5 :heavy_check_mark: | 6 | 7
---------------|---|---|---|---|--|---|---|--
(1) 1 | 0 | 1 | ~1 | 1 | ~1 | 1 | 1 | 1
(4) 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 5 | 5 |  | 
(5) 4 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(7) 5 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

If the `totalWeight` is **6** or greater and we have two `KnapsackItem` **(1 and 3)** which weights are less than `totalWeight` the best we can do is to select both items.

(value) weight | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  |4  | 5 | 6 :heavy_check_mark: | 7
---------------|---|---|---|---|--|---|---|--
(1) 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
(4) 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5
(5) 4 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
(7) 5 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Using similar algorithmic approach we fill `tableOfValues`.

(value) weight | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  |4  | 5 | 6 | 7
---------------|---|---|---|---|--|---|---|--
(1) 1 | 0 | 1 | 1| 1 | 1| 1 | 1 | 1
(4) 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5
(5) 4 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 9
(7) 5 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4 |  5| 7 | 8 | 9 :small_blue_diamond:

The answer for the problem is the value at `tableOfValues[3][7]` which is **9**.

## Code

The algorithm of the problem is if `totalWeight` is less than the `weight` of the `KnapsackItem` at index `itemIndex` in `knapsackItems` array, the maximum value at `tableOfValues[itemIndex][totalWeight]` will be whatever the best we can do without this `KnapsackItem`. 

Else if `totalWeight` is less than the weight of the `KnapsackItem`, the maximum value at `tableOfValues[itemIndex][totalWeight]` will be the `value` of the item + whatever `weight` is remaining after we select this `KnapsackItem` or what is the best we can do without selecting this `KnapsackItem`.

```swift
for itemIndex in 1...knapsackItems.count {
        for totalWeight in 1...capacityOfBag {
            
            if totalWeight < knapsackItems[itemIndex-1].weight {
                tableOfValues[itemIndex][totalWeight] = tableOfValues[itemIndex-1][totalWeight]
            } else {
                let remainingCapacity = totalWeight - knapsackItems[itemIndex-1].weight
                tableOfValues[itemIndex][totalWeight] = max(knapsackItems[itemIndex-1].value + tableOfValues[itemIndex-1][remainingCapacity], tableOfValues[itemIndex-1][totalWeight])
            }
        }
}
```
The solution for this problem is based on [Tushar Roy's 0-1 Knapsack Problem tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LusJS5-AGo&t=315s).
